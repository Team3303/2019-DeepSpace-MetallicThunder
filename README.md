## Description
This is our (FRC Team 3303's) code repository for FRC2019 Robot Code.
## Set Up Your Laptop for Programming
The first thing you'll need to do is to follow the instructions [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc) to download the code editor, programming language, and WPILib libraries+extensions which lets us program and control the Robot's code.

After you follow the instructions on that site, you will want to install `git`, which the popular tool that lets teams work together on code. GitHub uses git, of course, you probably are reading this on GitHub!

For Windows, simpy click [this](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.20.1.windows.1/Git-2.20.1-64-bit.exe) to download it instantly. The link comes from the official site, I just made it shorter by klinking to the actual download.

If you are using Mac, the download page is [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac), it should automatically download.

If you are on Linux, downloading `git` depends on what distribution of Linux you are running.
If you are running Debian or a Debian-based distro (like Ubuntu), then run
>`sudo apt update

Then:

>`sudo apt install git

If you are using Arch or an Arch-based distro (like Manjaro or Antergos) then a simple `sudo pacman -Sy git` Will do.

Other, but optional tools, include:
Vim/NeoVim (text editor, already comes with Git for Windows)
The GitLens plugin for Visual Studio code (shows information about who changed what, etc)
and the Vim plugin for Visual Studio Code. (gives you the power of Vim in VSCode)

If you ever want to learn how to use vim, load it up and type `:Tutor`. It is a nice 30M-1H tutorial for the basics of Vim. Vim is also very useful for being able to define and run macros, which you can use to make Vim automatically edit code quickly.
